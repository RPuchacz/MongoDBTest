1. J. Puchalski. [Dota 2 Matches](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches).
This dataset contains 50000 ranked ladder matches from the Dota 2 data dump created by Opendota. It was inspired by the Dota 2 Matches data published here by Joe Ramir. This is an update and improved version of that dataset. I have kept the same image and a similar title.
